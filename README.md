# Klassly photos retriever

Your school chooses for [Klass.ly](https://klass.ly)and you want to retrieve all your photos ?
This script is for you !

1. Configure the config.json with your username/phone & password
if needed, change the folder where your photos will be saved.
The others parameters may be changed if you you know what you do.
a priori, you don't have to change the KLASSLY and DEBUG categories.
2. Launch the script and wait it retrieves all your photos.
3. Enjoy !

# Warning
I made this script for a personal use.
It's maybe ugly (I'm pretty sure ;-)) but it works.

# History
The children's schhol uses Klass.ly platform. Teachers share more than 1.000 photos. Impossible for me to save one at a time (don't think to subscribe).
So yes, one thing to do : automate.
